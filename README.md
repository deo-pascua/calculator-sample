Simple calculator project
> The main concept that this project showcase is the familiarity with working on 3 aspects of web application mainly focused on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The core fundamentals of building a calculator with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are:

HTML: used to create the structure of the calculator by defining its elements and layout.

CSS: used to style the calculator by setting the colors, fonts, sizes, and other visual properties of its elements.

JavaScript: used to bring interactivity to the calculator by writing the logic for its operations and providing functionality for its buttons.

In this example, this JavaScript code defines a class called Calculator that is used to create a calculator object. The class has a constructor that takes two parameters: previousOperandTextElement and currentOperandTextElement. These are references to the HTML elements that display the previous operand and current operand in the calculator.

The constructor sets the values of these two elements as properties of the Calculator object. It also calls the clear method to initialize the calculator.

The rest of the code defines constant variables that reference different buttons on the calculator, such as number buttons, operation buttons, and clear buttons. These references are used later in the code to add event listeners to the buttons and perform actions when they are clicked.

The code also defines two constants previousOperandTextElement and currentOperandTextElement which reference the HTML elements that display the previous operand and the current operand in the calculator. These constants are passed as parameters to the Calculator class's constructor to create a new calculator object.

In summary, these are the core fundamentals of a calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

-Creating and styling a user interface with HTML and CSS.
-Implementing interactivity with JavaScript by listening to user events and updating the UI accordingly.
-Performing operations and calculations with JavaScript by manipulating data and evaluating expressions.
